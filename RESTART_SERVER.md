# RESTART YOUR SERVER NOW!

## In your PowerShell terminal:

1. Press **`Ctrl + C`** to stop the current server
2. Wait 2 seconds
3. Run: `php artisan serve`
4. Go to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/register`

**The error should be GONE!**

The new error handler will:
- ✅ Catch ALL PHP errors (notices, warnings, fatal errors)
- ✅ Log them to storage/logs/php_errors.log
- ✅ NEVER display them to users
- ✅ Keep your site looking professional

**After restarting, refresh your browser and the error will disappear!** 🎉
